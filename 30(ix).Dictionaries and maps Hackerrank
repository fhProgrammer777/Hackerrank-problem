/* in vector:-
\Though technically correct. I hope this becomes bad practice.If everybody just declares all their variables auto it will become hard 
for humans to read and understand (and we head down the road to untyped languages). The use of auto should be reserved for situations where we don't actually care about the type as
long as it behaves in a manor that we want (for example iterators, we don't actually care what iterator we
get as long as we can use it like an iterator).
